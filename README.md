# pollfi-backend

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Zappi/pollfi-backend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Zappi/pollfi-backend)

Pollfi is an easy way to create your very own polls and other (registered) users can answer to them. This project was a made for the Full Stack programming course in the University of Helsinki. This project was built with React, node.js and MongoDB. The project still has some issues which I might fix in the future and there is a lot to do with the UI(there is really nothing fancy except the responsivity).
